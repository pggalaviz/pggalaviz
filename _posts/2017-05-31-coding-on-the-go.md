This post is special, it was completely typed from my iPhone. It's been about 2 years since I don't have a laptop. Despite the fact I own a 27 inch 5k iMac (which is the perfect workstation for me) I have a lack of mobility, but this is over.

I own an iPhone and an iPad, and after just some minutes spent trying to solve this issue with them I've found several tools that prove to be helpful.

The first one is called **Buffer Editor** a text editor for iOS, it offers highlighting for several languages such as Javascript and Ruby, and after just 5 minutes between downloading it and configuring it, I'm able to start editing. It has support for Github cloning, pulling, pushing, etc. as well as connecting to a remote server via SSH or FTP and other functionalities, which is awesome, but what I love the most is: it supports VIM style! 
Connect a BT keyboard and you're good to go.

The other tools are **Termius** which is a terminal emulator that also allows SSH connections, and **Working Copy** which is a Git client that also let you edit, clone, commit, etc.

Obviously it's not the same as a full blown workstation, and in no way it's meant to replace it, but it's a very portable solution and perfect for simple tasks.
