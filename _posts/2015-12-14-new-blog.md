After some time with my completely static site I decided to start a new blog, this because I want to share some of the knowledge I've acquired after a couple years on the web development boat.

I hope that somebody can find any of these posts of interest and that they help the same way I've found help somewhere else.

You can find me on [Twitter][twitter], [Facebook][facebook] and [Github][github].

```javascript
console.log('Welcome!');
```
